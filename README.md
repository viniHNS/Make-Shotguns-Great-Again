# Make Shotguns Great Again!

#### [EN](README.md) | [PT_BR](README_BR.md)

## What is this?

This is a mod for [SPT-AKI](https://www.sp-tarkov.com "The main goal of the project is to provide a separate offline single-player experience with ready-to-use progression for the official BSG client. Now you can play Escape From Tarkov while waiting for their servers to come back online, while you're disconnected from the Internet, or if you need to take a break from cheaters.") that improves the shotguns in the game!

## What does this mod do?

Some shotguns like the Saiga12K and the Benelli M3 have some issues. This mod aims to fix them, such as:

- The Saiga12K now has a Full Auto mode.
- The semi-automatic mode of the Benelli M3 has been slightly adjusted, similar to other semi-automatic shotguns in the game, such as the MP-155 and MP-153.

## Installation

Just place the `user` folder in your game's `SPT` installation directory.
