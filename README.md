#### [EN](README.md) | [PT_BR](README_BR.md)

## What is this?

This is a mod for [SPT](https://www.sp-tarkov.com "The main goal of the project is to provide a separate offline single-player experience with ready-to-use progression for the official BSG client. Now you can play Escape From Tarkov while waiting for their servers to come back online, while you're disconnected from the Internet, or if you need to take a break from cheaters.") that improves the shotguns in the game and adds new attachments, guns, and ammunition.

## What does this mod do?

Adds some features to the shotguns in the game and new attachments for them:

- ~~The Saiga12K now has a Full Auto mode. (be careful with the recoil ಠ_ಠ)~~ Full auto version exists in the game now.
- The semi-automatic mode of the Benelli M3 has been slightly adjusted, similar to other semi-automatic shotguns in the game, such as the MP-155 and MP-153.
- The ETMI-019 and Kiba Arms SPRM rail mounts are now compatible with more optics and mounts.
- Now you can put the Kiba Arms SPRM rail mount and the AK GP-25 accessory kit recoil pad
in the KS-23M.
- The ETMI-019 and Kiba Arms SPRM rail mounts can now be equipped on the MTs-255
- Now the saiga-12k can use most of the AKs handguards.

Malfunction Overhaul:
* **Skip Inspection Before Clearing**
    * Allows players to clear a weapon malfunction immediately using the clear keybind, bypassing the requirement to visually inspect the weapon first.

* **Remove Boss Forced Malfunctions**
    * Prevents bosses (such as Kollontay) from triggering scripted, forced weapon malfunctions on the player's active firearm. This ensures that jams are only caused by weapon condition or ammunition stats.

These can be adjusted in the BepInEx config (F12)
